    <p>The Rock candy recipe inspired from the television show <em>Breaking Bad</em>.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Corn Syrup</li>
        <li>Granulated Sugar</li>
        <li>Clear flavoring extract</li>
        <li>Blue gel food coloring</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine water, light corn syrup, and granulated sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Stir until the sugar is moistened and dissolves.</li>
        <li>Brush down the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush – this will remove any stray sugar crystals. 
            Sugar crystals in the pan can cause your whole batch to crystallize.</li>
        <li>Once it comes to a boil, insert a candy thermometer. From this point on, do not stir the candy.</li>
        <li>Cook the candy until it reaches 290 F on the thermometer. It should be a light yellowish color.</li>
        <li>Immediately remove the pan from the heat. 
            Let it sit for a minute, until the rapid bubbling stops, then add flavoring extract and blue gel food coloring.</li>
        <li>Stir well until the color is evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Pour the hot candy out onto a baking sheet covered with foil. 
            You can spread it into a thinner layer with the spatula if you’d like.</li>
        <li>Let the candy cool completely at room temperature, until it is set and hard.</li>
        <li>Use a knife or kitchen mallet to smash it up into smaller pieces.</li>
        <li>This candy is easiest to eat in large pieces, so some people prefer to leave it in big chunks. 
            If you want to be more accurate to the show, you can crush it up into smaller chunks.</li>
    </ol>
